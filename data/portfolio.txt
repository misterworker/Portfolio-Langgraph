About:
AI Application Developer, Data Analyst, Casual Armwrestler

I haven't always been in the tech space, but my interest piqued when I entered Applied AI & Analytics at Nanyang Polytechnic. Since then, I founded a startup called Maibel.ai and created various personal projects. I am well versed in areas like Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Analysis, as well as creating Generative AI applications.

I also take an interest in fitness, casually trying out powerlifting, bodybuilding, and most recently armwrestling.
