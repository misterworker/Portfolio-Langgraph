Solution - Used Car Price Predictor (MLOps)

End-to-End ML Pipeline:
1. Dataset Versioning: Managed with DVC + Google Cloud Storage for reproducibility.
2. Dependency & Config Management: Poetry (dependencies) + Hydra (dynamic hyperparameter tuning).
3. Experiment Tracking: MLflow logs model performance & hyperparameter variations.

Model Training & Deployment:
1. PyCaret-based pipeline:
    a) EDA → Identifies dataset trends.
    b) Model selection & tuning → Uses compare_models() to optimize performance.
    c) Pipeline storage → Trained models stored as pickled files.
2. Deployment with BentoML (efficient, scalable inference):
    a) Automatic endpoint creation & batch processing for real-time predictions.
    b) Preprocessing & inference logic managed in bentoml/service.py.

Web App & API Integration:
Next.js frontend for car price predictions with a BentoML API backend.

Features:
1. Batch predictions for multiple cars.
2. Random auto-fill for easy testing.
3. Real-time results displayed interactively.
