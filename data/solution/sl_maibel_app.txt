Solution - Maibel AI App

AI System Architecture:
An Agent Supervisor manages four bots, each with a specific role:

1. Validation Bot: Ensures response quality using GPT-4o-mini, detecting nonsensical or manipulative inputs.
2. Recommendation Bot: Adjusts challenges based on user behavior (e.g., increasing daily water intake).
3. Challenge Bot: Tracks real-time progress, managing challenge completion and voluntary deductions.
4. Conversational Bot: Engages users in regular chat, using dynamic prompts, vector search (Pinecone), and memory storage (Postgres).

Custom Avatars:
Users define their AI coachâ€™s name, background, gender, and personality (e.g., "Analytical" or "Motivating"). These attributes 
personalize chatbot interactions.

Deployment & Testing:
1. Built with React Native and deployed via Expo to Apple Store & Google Play for internal testing (~15 users).
2. Overcame a major Expo development build issue after extensive debugging (solution: https://stackoverflow.com/a/79362466/25544913).
